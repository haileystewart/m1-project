              <p>I was the first in my family to go to college and graduate school. I had a full scholarship for undergraduate. But had to take out massive public and private student loans to attend grad school to get my doctorate (I come from a family who always lived below the poverty line). So I should have been able to pay back those loans easily right? Wrong. Many things happened along the way…. Divorce, relocation, both parents suffered strokes so I became their caregiver/sole provider along with caring for my own two children as a single mom. Here I am, 20 years later and I still owe $104,000 and I my oldest child is now filling out her FAFSA. I will NEVER get my loans paid off with 4 dependents (disabled parents and my children). Not to mention never being able to retire because of them. It is hopeless.            </p>

                <h3>Why we want to solve this problem</h3>
                <p>People have millions of horror stories about student loans. We want to establish a comfortable environment where students may not only learn about their finances, but also share their experiences and anxieties. Students should to have access to as many resources as they require, as well as the opportunity to learn about alternate ways to manage their student loans or avoid them altogether.</p>

                <p>I am a 37 year old, mom of 3. I recently was diagnosed with Chronic Lyme disease and this disease has taken over my body, especially my lifeline, my back. Funny thing is, I am, or I was a Chiropractor. I can not longer do my job to help other get well and stay well as I am struggling daily on my end to do the same thing for myself and my family. I haven't had income in over a year now and the student loans are piling up.</p>
