<!--figure out integrate multiple css sheets for each html part-->
<!--The problem might be that the html document can have multiple head tags within one document so you have to ass everything to one head and body tag,but
with that comes the problem of first the stylesheets will all be in the same head tag which will apply all the elements to the website in the order that they
are listed regardless of whether is goes there or not basically conflicting commands will be happening-->

<!--A solution that could work is going back to creating multiple web pages that utilize a nav bar with links to get through each pages then all we do is have all the
css colors, fonts, etc in uniformity-->

<!--Add background color for website
Insert clipart for infographic
editing the alignment for infographic
set dodont to center
add video flexible width-->
