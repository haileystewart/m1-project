        <h3><u>Common Student Loan Terminology</u></h3>
        <div class="Common">
            <ol class="C">
            <li><h4>Principal</h4></li>
            <p>Principal is the original loan amount you borrowed. For example, if you take out one $100,000 loan for graduate school, that loan's principal is $100,000.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Great Credit</li>
                <li>Good Credit</li>
                <li>Bad Credit</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h4>Term</h4></li>
            <p>The expected amount of time the loan will be in repayment. Generally speaking, a longer term will mean lower monthly payments but higher interest over the life of the loan, while a shorter term will mean the opposite. Loan terms vary by lender, and if you have a federal loan, you are usually able to select your student loan repayment plan.</p>
            <li><h4>Promissory Note</h4></li>
            <p>A contract that says you’ll repay a loan under certain agreed-upon terms. This document legally controls your borrowing arrangement, so read your promissory note carefully. If you don’t fully understand the agreement, contact your lender before you sign.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Origination Fee</h4></li>
            <p>A fee that some lenders charge for processing the loan application, or in lieu of upfront interest. To minimize incremental costs on your loan, look for lenders that offer no or low fees.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Accrued Interest</h4></li>
            <p>The amount of interest that has accumulated on a loan since your last payment. You can keep accrued interest in check by making your payments on time each month. However, after a period of missed or reduced payments, accrued interest may be capitalized, which essentially means you’d have to pay interest on the student loan accrued interest.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Amortization</h4></li>
            <p>Amortization refers to the amount of loan principal and interest you pay off incrementally over your loan term. Each student loan payment is a fixed amount that contributes to both interest and principal. Early in the life of the loan, the majority of each payment goes toward interest. But over time as you pay down your loan balance, the ratio shifts and most of the payment goes toward the principal.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Annual Percentage Rate</h4></li>
            <p>The annual rate that is charged for borrowing, expressed as an annual percentage. APR is a standardized calculation that allows you to make a more fair comparison of different loans. Generally speaking, the lower your APR, the less you’ll spend on interest over the life of the loan.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Great Rate</li>
                <li>Good Rate</li>
                <li>Bad Rate</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h4>Co-Signer</h4></li>
            <p>A third party, such as a parent, who contractually agrees to accept equal responsibility in repaying your loan(s). A student loan cosigner can be valuable if your credit score or financial history are not sufficient enough to allow you to borrow on your own. With a cosigner, you are still responsible for paying back the loan, but the cosigner must step in if you are unable to make payments. 
            </p>
            <li><h4>Grace Period</h4></li>
            <p>A period of time after you graduate, leave school or drop below half-time during which you’re not required to make payments on certain loans. Some loans continue to accumulate interest during the grace period, and that interest is typically capitalized, making your loan more expensive.</p>
            <li><h4>Loan Servicer</h4></li>
            <p>A company your lender may partner with to administer your loan and collect payments. For questions about your student loan payments or administrative details such as account information, you should contact your student loan servicer.
            </p>
            <li><h4>London InterBank Offered Rate(LIBOR)</h4></li>
            <p>An interest rate benchmark commonly used by banks and other lenders to set interest rates for loans. Many variable student loans are tied to LIBOR, which means that your loan’s APR will rise or fall based on the movement of the index. Rates are typically adjusted on a monthly basis.

        <h3><u>The Potential Student Loan Pitfalls</u></h3>
        <div class="Pitfalls">
            <ol class="P" start="12">
                <li><h4>Default</h4></li>
                <p>Failure to repay a loan according to the terms agreed to in the promissory note. Defaulting on your student loans can have serious consequences, such as additional fees, wage garnishment, and a significant negative impact on your credit. It’s always better to talk to your lender about potential hardship repayment options, such as deferment or forbearance, before defaulting on a loan.</p>
                <li><h4>Deferment</h4></li>
                <p>The temporary postponement of loan repayment, during which time you may not be responsible for paying interest that accrues (on certain types of loans). Student loan deferment can be useful if you think you’ll be in a better place to pay your loans at a later date. However, deferment is usually only available for certain federal loans. To potentially cut down on interest, it may be wise to weigh your deferment options.
                </p>
                <li><h4>Forbearance</h4></li>
                <p>The temporary postponement of loan repayment, during which time interest typically continues to accrue on all types of federal student loans. If your student loan is in forbearance you can either pay off the interest as it accrues, or you can allow the interest to accrue and it will be capitalized at the end of your forbearance.</p>
                <li><h4>Capitalized Interest</h4></li>
                <p>Accrued interest that is added to your loan’s principal balance, typically after a period of non-payment such as forbearance. When the interest is tacked onto your principal balance, your interest is now calculated on that new amount.</p>
                <li><h4>Direct Loan Consolidation Program</h4></li>
                <p>The act of combining two or more loans into one loan with a single interest rate and term. The resulting interest rate is a weighted average of the original loan rates—rounded up to the nearest eighth of a percentage point.
                </p>
                <li><h4>Private Lender Consolidation</h4></li>
                <p>The act of combining two or more loans into one single loan with a single interest rate and term. When you consolidate loans with a private lender, you do so through the act of refinancing, so you’re given a new (hopefully lower) interest rate or lower payments with a longer term.</p>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <!--Start of Savers Section-->
        <hr>
        <h3><u>Potential Money Savers</u></h3>
        <div class="Savers">
            <ol start="18">
                <li><h4>Student Loan Refinancing</h4></li>
                <p>Taking out a new loan at a lower interest rate and using it to pay off your original loan(s), potentially lowering your overall interest rate.</p>
                <li><h4>Automated Clearing House(ACH) Payment</h4></li>
                <p>An electronic funds transfer is sent through the Automated Clearing House system. The ACH is an electronic funds—transfer system that helps your loan payment transfer directly from your bank account to your lender or loan servicer each month.</p>
                <li><h4>Pre Payment</h4></li>
                <p>Paying off the loan early or making more than the minimum payment. All education loans, including private and federal loans, allow for penalty-free prepayment, which means you can pay more than the monthly minimum or make extra payments without incurring a fee. The faster you pay off your loan, the less you’ll spend on interest.</p>
